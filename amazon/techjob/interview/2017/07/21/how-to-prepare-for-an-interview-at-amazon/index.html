  <article class="post-content">
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: I am currently a Senior SDE at Amazon Web Services (and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juli1">I am hiring</a>, my team
is <em>awesome</em>, please message me if you are interested). Opinions there are my own and does not represent the one from my
employer.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> is a major tech company and 
is a leader in many domains, which gives a lot of jobs opportunities (like working on Cloud Computing via <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon
Web Services</a>, Retail via
<a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> or Virtual Assistant via
<a href="http://alexa.amazon.com]">Alexa</a>. Thousands of people want to work there
and the interview is <strong>hard</strong>.
This is very common to find people frustrated because they have been rejected,
like this on <a href="http://www.quora.com">Quora</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/interview-rejection.png" alt="Interview Rejection Post on Quora" /></p>

<p>The interview is hard and even if you <em>think</em> you did great, you probably did not. 
<strong>Reality check</strong>: this is really hard to get another perspective (see pic below). And unfortunately,
we probably do not perform as good as we think most of the time.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/rhino.jpg" alt="Rhino" /></p>

<p>As a senior SDE working there, I wanted to share some advices on how to prepare
for your interview. These advices are mine and are limited to my knowledge and experience.
Do not consider them as the only good practices, these are just my perspective (see pic above).</p>

<h1 id="demystify-the-interview">Demystify the interview</h1>
<p>First of all, do not focus too much on the outcome on the interview. Hope and shoot for the best
but keep in mind it might not happen.</p>

<p>Interviewing is like dating. You prepare, you try to be at your best and you will be
stressed. This shows that you care about the job. But if it does not work out, no worries, 
there are plenty of fish in the sea. But if it works, you do not have
to seal the deal right away: a company that is rejected by a candidate is likely to come back later.</p>

<p>But first thing first, you <strong>have to be prepared</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="work-on-coding-know-your-basics">Work on coding. Know your basics</h1>
<p>The general advice, no matter the tech company is to know your basics:
algorithms, data structure, complexity, you <strong>have to know</strong> these topics.
If you do not know, do not even go and try, you will waste your time.</p>

<p>I would advise to read at list two books:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://elementsofprogramminginterviews.com/">Elements of Programming Interviews</a>: the most complete
 resource to be prepared for algorithmic, design and other technical aspects</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/">Cracking the Code Interview</a>: a
 good second book that explains also what to expect during the interview.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you think you already know your basics and you do not need this, think twice.
Reading <em>Elements of Programming Interviews</em> will definitively refresh your skills.</p>

<p>You can also go for a mock interview, a coding bootcamp. Whatever. Be ready to write
code on whiteboard and answer to some basic questions.</p>

<h1 id="know-the-leadership-principles-">Know the leadership principles â€¦</h1>
<p>Technical (coding/system design) skills constitute 100% of a hiring decision. The other 100% is guided
by the leadership principles. The ratio might be be accurate (no kidding!), but what I want to highlight there
is that most books and advices do not dive deep on this topic while this is very important. Knowing
the leadership principles shows your culture fit and your understanding of the company principles. If you do not know them:</p>

<p><strong>Learn them.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Right.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Now.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/principles">https://www.amazon.jobs/principles</a></p>

<p>Learn and show you understand them. Connect your own experience with these principles.
Explain how you apply <em>customer obsession</em>, <em>frugality</em>, <em>bias for action</em> or <em>learn and be curious</em> in your
actual job. Doing this will prepare you for your interview.</p>

<p>This is an important part of an interview because these principles
drive our work every day in the company. <strong>Showing that you
understand and follow these principles is key</strong>.</p>

<p>Also, do not make up stories, <strong>be sincere, real</strong>. If you do not know something, say it
and ask for more clarifications or to have another question to evaluate you. This is very easy for an interviewer
to see when somebody is making up a story.</p>

<h2 id="-and-do-basic-search-about-the-company">â€¦ and do basic search about the company</h2>

<p>Learn about the job and do some research about the division you are interviewing for (lab126, AWS, etc.).
Know the products they are developing. This will show you are interested about the job and you care about it.
Do not overdo it, just know the basic information: products, target, overall development plan, major leaders, etc.</p>

<h1 id="practice-a-lot">Practice a lot</h1>

<p>Practice, every day. Start with practicing on <a href="http://www.leetcode.com">leetcode</a>, <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">geeksforgeeks</a> or any other
online coding site. Solve at least 4 problems a day (for example, 2 in the
morning, 2 in the evening). Make sure you solved at least 4 to 5 problems in
every category (arrays, tree, linked-list, etc.) before scheduling any interview
(even a mock).</p>

<p>Buy a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lifetree-Stick-Message-Sticker-78-7-Inch/dp/B015O5QOY6/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1500784523&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=whiteboard+sticker">whiteboard</a>.
It costs nothing (~$10) and will help you to practice in real conditions.</p>

<p>Do not bother having a coach. This is non-sense, a waste of time and money.
Just work hard, every day for several weeks in a row. Stop coding on your
computer and switch to the whiteboard exclusively.</p>

<h1 id="go-out-and-interview-periodically">Go out and interview periodically</h1>

<p><strong>Interviewing is like a muscle</strong>: you need to practice so that you do not loose your
ability to interview. Even if you are at your dream job today, continue
to practice to keep it strong. This is very important to keep this ability up and
running. You can do that in different ways: you can either practice with a
friend or just apply to positions to evaluate yourself.</p>

<p>Remember, interviewing is like dating, you can go interview but <em>do not have
to</em> accept any offer. If you refuse, the other party will contact
you later to check what you are up to. And even if you refuse it, 
having a nice offer will boost your ego and give your value
on the market (always good to take!).</p>

<h1 id="same-player-try-again">Same player, try again</h1>

<p>Even if you prepare at your best, there is still a chance you will not be
selected. There are many reasons a candidate will not receive an offer. Your
goal is to be prepared at best to reduce the probably of being rejected.
But it can happen for various reasons. <strong>And that is ok</strong>.</p>

<p>Do not take this personal. Consider this as a learning opportunity to
improve and re-apply few months after. After few days, you will know where you
probably made a mistake and can work on improving. The process is generally
oriented towards false positive, this is why recruiters will probably re-contact
after a few months to re-apply.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
