        <title>On Culture</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Culture is everything. It makes us feel connected. It gives us a sense of belonging, a sense of purpose.
Either in society or companies, culture is what bonds a set of people with values they all believe in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a business standpoint, culture is also what can make or break a company.
Which is more important in startups: a startup is a cult, a religion.
A startup needs to have true believers, people who trust a company can make the impossible possible.
And companies with a well-defined and strong culture are the ones that are the most likely to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Amazon. New hires must read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us/leadership-principles&quot;&gt;leadership principles&lt;/a&gt;,
a set of core values every single employee must follow. All Amazonians operate, breathe and live by these principles.
If you do not embrace them, you will not only have a hard time working there but will ultimately
be let go. There are simple, actionable rules everybody must apply in their daily work.
For example, no slides are presented during meetings: all meetings start with a 1, 3 or 6 pagers document that
all employees must read before the meeting. Efficiency at its best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Coinbase. Two years ago, its CEO made it clear that Coimbase is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804&quot;&gt;mission-focused company&lt;/a&gt;
and that activities that do not help or support the company’s mission will not be tolerated. At this time,
this document made waves and a huge backlash ensued. But today, employees know what is the mission
of the company and what is expected from them. And new employees joining Coinbase know exactly
what to expect and what rules will be used to evaluated their performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Shopify. Less than a year ago, Shopify CEO also made it clear that political discourse is
not welcome within the company. More importantly, he emphasized that the company was not a family
but a team. The team must play at its best and when a player is no longer an A player, they must
be let go. This clearly shows how employees are evaluated and what rules they should follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When culture is not defined or weak (e.g. no reinforcement), others will define
the culture for you. There will be no common understanding of working rules and
chaos will slowly but surely ensue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping a strong culture makes sure that everybody (1) knows the rules of the game and (2) will follow these rules,
which is better for the company operators and the employees. For the company operator, it ensures that every single
employee or contractor shares the company vision and is dedicated to making the company successful.
For employees, it ensures that they are not wasting their time working in an environment
they dislike. Some people may not like the culture and ultimately leave, which is
a short-term issue and an opportunity to have new people with better alignment with the company values.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>So, you want to start a company?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Many people want to start a company. They have &lt;em&gt;an idea&lt;/em&gt;, believe that making a product is easy and
if you know how to write some lines of code, overnight success is guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is here to put some reality in perspective. Entrepreneurship is overly romanticized through thousands of articles
detailing the overnight success of a founder, company, or product. But it’s often not what you imagine
and the success is the result of nights of grind, hard work, sweat, and tears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting a company is incredibly hard. The vast majority of companies do not survive. A team works relentlessly
hard on a product for months, only to see no users sign up (other than their family and friends).
It crushes their hope of building something useful when all they need is the mental energy to keep iterating and make a
product that delights users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building the right product is way more complicated than it seems. You may have worked in big companies
that have thousands or millions of users but you have no idea how they started and got the initial users.
Finding the right feature, what &lt;em&gt;users&lt;/em&gt; (and not you) find useful is often counter-intuitive and requires many iterations
and experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assembling the right team is critical and is no easy task. You have constrained resources as you cannot offer
the same compensation as other big tech companies. You need to hire &lt;em&gt;“believers”&lt;/em&gt;, people that will understand and follow your vision, no matter how crazy it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marketing and selling a product is a complex task that is totally different from writing lines of code. You need
to understand how to present a product, how to define and refine a sales process to close your first customers.
That is no easy task and you constantly need to learn from others how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you go and raise money from Venture Capital, you need to talk to investors, articulate your vision to
show the opportunity. At the earliest stage, people will believe and trust you to build the right company
and it’s your responsibility to build trust and show them your progress weeks after weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, starting a company is &lt;em&gt;fucking&lt;/em&gt; hard. If you are still up for it, know that customers will complain,
your initial product will suck, you will have to fire employees, some people will betray you and investors
will ask when you will be profitable. All of this with a high probability of 0 return whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not take me wrong, I have no regret. As somebody that lost half of his weight
within a year (from 300 to 150 pounds) and ran ultra-marathons, I enjoy the pain and
I would not trade places for anything in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Going on premise early is a bad idea</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time, I thought going on-premise was the biggest revenue driver for early-stage startups. I had this belief so deep in my brain that I planned to develop an on-premise solution for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codiga.io&quot;&gt;Codiga&lt;/a&gt;. However, after talking to other founders and advisors, I started to realize this was probably a decision that could sink an early-stage company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that these advices/opinions may not be applicable for all companies or products. The following post explains my reasons, and I am sure it might not apply to many cases. Take this post as a compilation of personal opinions, nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-all-about-focus&quot;&gt;It’s all about focus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a company (and, to some extent, managing your life) is about resource allocation (how you spend your time, collaborators, and money).
When going on-premise, as the software is no longer deployed in your infrastructure, you need to provide a significant amount of resources to your customers, making sure your solution works seamlessly in their infrastructure. You are not in control of software deployment anymore
and this is your responsibility to make sure your customers are happy. And you will inevitably spend time making sure they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, as you need to sell to big customers and keep the flywheel going, you need to invest in sales:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Develop (and refine) a sales process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find prospects, schedule demo, follow-up every call, even when customers do not qualify.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Develop marketing to target some specific vital people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your focus shifts from innovation and product-focused company to a sales-focused company. As an early-stage company, your resources are very limited, and investing significant time in sales takes resources away from being innovative. Even if you hire a sales force (which will be limited to one salesperson and one customer manager at this stage), you have to allocate a few engineers to work with them and support the on-premise version of your product. These engineers will not work on innovative features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-finance-does-not-check-out&quot;&gt;The finance does not check out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you price your product at $40 per user per seat for your on-premise version. At this price point, to get $500,000 of ARR, it means you need to have more than 1,000 paying users for your on-premise version. With many accounts being around 50 to 100 users, you have roughly 15 accounts to manage and make sure they are happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To manage these 15 accounts, you will need at least one sales representative, two customer managers, and one engineer to debug or troubleshoot issues for your customers. These resources will already cost more than $500,000 per year, which means that even if your on-premise solution yields significant revenue, your business does not make a profit. You not only shifted your focus to sales (see previous point) but you are
also not profitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future-is-the-public-cloud&quot;&gt;The future is the public cloud&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some customers want to deploy on-premise and will always invoke some reasons for it (the VP of engineering/CEO/CTO invokes security reasons, some engineers claim that they can save large amount of $$$, etc.). The reality is that fewer and fewer companies will stay on-premises. Years ago, the narrative was about security: the public cloud was seen as being insecure/unsafe. Since that time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/capital-one-all-in-on-aws/&quot;&gt;Capital One&lt;/a&gt; started to use AWS, new tech companies are starting in the public cloud and existing ones are moving to the public cloud (e.g., Twitter). Even the US government has its public cloud today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trend will continue. Companies noticed the trend and adapted, asking their customers to go to the public cloud. Atlassian is a good example and announces the end of support for the on-premise version of their product. The reality is that on-premise products will become a niche market and more costly to support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arguments presented above may not apply to all companies and should be taken from a grain of salt.
I believe that early-stage companies should focus on innovation and Product-Market Fit
(e.g., make something users want), not on sales to a specific niche. If your product is &lt;em&gt;that good&lt;/em&gt;, companies
may even have to adapt. 12 years ago, very few companies would have accepted to have all their company conversations
and data stored on machines they do not control and today, the large majority use Google Docs, Office 365
or Slack. These products are so popular that these companies have no choice but to use these products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue when developing an on-premise version of a SaaS product at an early stage
is that it forces you to reallocate your resources from developing a great product
to selling and supporting an on-premise version. It will slow you from making a great product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, these arguments may not be correct at later stages when you can afford to
allocate resources to develop a sales and customer support team without impacting innovation.
But at this stage, you may already have enough traction and revenue not even to consider going on-premise.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The founder starter kit</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After a year of founding &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codiga.io&quot;&gt;Codiga&lt;/a&gt; and running it solo, I now have a pretty good idea about the good tools to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are my guidelines to evaluate the service:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Least friction&lt;/strong&gt;: easy to sign-up and offboard if there is an issue and/or you have better options&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency pricing&lt;/strong&gt;: you can see how much you will pay on the website. Starting using the service does not require a call with a sales rep with shady prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many products and services require either (1) a sales call or (2) multiple emails back and forth. Ultimately, if they do not adapt, such services are going to die because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;they cannot scale (manual operations are expensive, which is reflected in the price)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;people do not want interaction ; they want a service that works out of the box&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;before-you-start&quot;&gt;Before you start&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Register your company in Delaware (if you are planning to be backed by venture capital). Online platforms provide services without much pain, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas&quot;&gt;Stripe Atlas&lt;/a&gt;. Being in Delaware is essential if you plan to raise funding.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get a lawyer. There are good firms around for startups such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodwinlaw.com/&quot;&gt;Goodwin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gunder.com/&quot;&gt;Gunder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get an accountant. A good accountant will take you few thousand dollars a year and ensure everything is on track, reported, and accurate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-services-to-use&quot;&gt;What services to use&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email&lt;/strong&gt;: GSuite is the industry standard to manage/handle your daily email, calendar, etc. Do not wait to get your google account started. Just pay $12/month.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt;: make mandatory that &lt;strong&gt;ALL&lt;/strong&gt; employees/contractors/collaborators to enable 2FA.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important&lt;/strong&gt;: use Gsuite to sign up for services and use SSO authentication, so that enable/disable accounts is easy.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accounting&lt;/strong&gt;: even if I dislike intuit for their yearly spam notice about taxes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://quickbooks.intuit.com/&quot;&gt;quickbooks&lt;/a&gt; is the standard for bookkeeping.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slack&lt;/strong&gt;: a must-have for communication today, start paying or switch to Discord. Just set your mind on the right communication channel.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hosting&lt;/strong&gt;: use &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt; as they have plenty of discount with many VC. By taking AWS, you are pretty sure you will not pay any cloud expenses until series B. You will likely receive $10,000 to $20,000 credits until you raise series A and an additional $100,000 credits until series B. After that, you should have enough $$$ to cover your cloud bills or find better alternatives. And yes, you might prefer &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;another-cheaper-cloud-provider&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; but (1) they are not as reliable as AWS and (2) they do not offer the same discounts or services.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design&lt;/strong&gt;: sign up for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.figma.com/&quot;&gt;Figma&lt;/a&gt; for your whole team. Just the best design tool I have seen for design. Signing up for any Adobe product pulls you back in the 90s.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Captable management&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://carta.com/&quot;&gt;Carta&lt;/a&gt; is the industry’s gold standard, but (1) they are costly early-stage, and (2) their customer service is terrible. I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://cakeequity.com/us&quot;&gt;Cake&lt;/a&gt;, which costs me about $800 a year (vs. $5000 for Carta).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source code management&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; is now the industry standard for source code management and all your employees are familiar with it. A good alternative is GitLab. Avoid Bitbucket because their user interface/user experience is terrible, the support for CI/CD tool is limited and the number of integrations is also very limited.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datadoghq.com/&quot;&gt;Datadog&lt;/a&gt; is just the best monitoring tool on the market. Easy to configure and use, you get your monitoring stack up and running in less than one hour.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOC-2 certification&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://secureframe.com/&quot;&gt;Secureframe&lt;/a&gt;: if you have a SaaS business and needs SOC-2 compliance, Secureframe facilitates all the certification/audit process. SOC-2 used to be a $70,000 to $80,000 line item ; companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://secureframe.com/&quot;&gt;Secureframe&lt;/a&gt; automate a lot of the process and make it available between $10,000 to $20,000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>One year as a startup founder</title>
        <description>&lt;div style=&quot;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden;&quot;&gt; &lt;iframe style=&quot;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; src=&quot;https://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/xtftd?autoplay=1&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a year since I left Twitter to start my own company. Within a year, I have been
through the startup rollercoaster: joining an accelerator, discussing with corporate
development about aquisition offers, and of course, fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Techstars, a repeated startup founder/CEO told me this truth:
&lt;em&gt;“A startup CEO has three jobs: explain the vision, hire and fire, don’t run out of money”&lt;/em&gt;.
One year after, I firmly believe this is true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on this year, there are a few takeaways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;think-first-principles&quot;&gt;Think first principles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When starting a company and going through an accelerator, you get exposed to hundreds
of opinions from the accelerator itself, other founders, employees, advisors, mentors,
investors. It’s your responsibility to evaluate them and make sound decisions for your business.
It’s easy to get lost in the myriad of opinions others have about your company and product, especially
so early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to walk through this jungle of advice, weed 90+% and keep the best. To do that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle&quot;&gt;first principles&lt;/a&gt; and come back to your core ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Base your strategy on metrics and not what some random person told you to do.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take decisions that follow the culture you want to instill in your company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I just explained seems essential, and still, I see many founders getting distracted
and lost by bad advice. One book that helps think with first principles
is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Life-Work-Ray-Dalio-audio-cd/dp/1508243247&quot;&gt;Principles&lt;/a&gt;
from Ray Dahlio. I read this book in 2021, and it helped me get back on track when lost under hundreds of opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-hire-is-better-than-a-bad-hire&quot;&gt;No hire is better than a bad hire&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiring is hard. This is one of the most challenging problems in the startup world,
especially at the very early stages. One bad hire can ruin your culture, team, and runway.
One good hire can work hard and do their best to deliver a delightful product your customers will love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to have the conviction that the people you hire are among the best
to work on the problem you are solving. If you do not have this conviction, you waste your time and money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When choosing an employee or co-founder, you need to admire this person for what they
can deliver in their domain. Like a relationship, you do not need to agree on
everything, but you need to (1) admire and recognize them as an expert in their domain and in the value they deliver and
(2) ensure that they fit with the company culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the french saying goes: &lt;em&gt;“Mieux vaut être seul que mal accompagné”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-get-distracted-and-learn-to-say-no&quot;&gt;Don’t get distracted and learn to say no&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get distracted. You often get distracted by an opinion from an investor,
a specific ask from one company, or just by the flow of meetings people want to have with you.
It’s a trap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an idea comes, evaluate the value it can bring to your business. It’s easy to go down a rabbit hole to implement a new feature, product, or hire a specific person. But if this proposition does not bring value to your business: say no and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Football players do not get distracted on the field. Be the same: you are here for the home run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;focus-on-pmf-build-something-people-love&quot;&gt;Focus on PMF, build something people love&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One main takeaway from Techstars has been focusing on Product-Market Fit (PMF).
Put it in simple terms; it just means people want what you are building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make a product people love, delight customers with valuable, carefully crafted features.
Your primary focus at the seed stage must be to get to PMF. If you get to PMF, sales will (normally) follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some companies do not have PMF. Some raise giant financing rounds without having PMF.
All of this is great, but one day, the reality of the market comes back,
and the company has a hard time closing any sale. To avoid that trap, don’t get distracted
and focus on PMF.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reality Distortion</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In personal or professional relations, I realized that failure comes from the distortion of reality. You and 1+ other person(s) do not have the same vision of reality. Our vision of reality is biased, and we want to see the truth and facts better than they look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your company fails because your vision of the market did not match the reality, or/and your product sucks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your customer did not sign the contract; you thought they liked your product way more than you think&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your friend did not contact you because you are way less attractive or interesting than you think and they don’t have time for you&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your partner wants to separate despite you thinking your relation was significant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list could go on and on. The fact is that you and 1+ person(s) do not share the same reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all have biases and mental shortcuts that let us live in a distorted reality.
The longer we live in this false reality, the more challenging and expensive it costs to escape it.
Over the last years, it has hit me hard in friendship, relationships, or business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the solution here? While I do not have the perfect plan, there are some solutions I use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Match &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; reality with &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; metrics&lt;/strong&gt;: measure what you think is happening in the world and compare it to your vision and opinions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;: have a friend or partner give &lt;em&gt;honest&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;non-biased&lt;/em&gt; feedback. And listen to them. The hardest part is getting somebody open and not afraid to tell you how wrong you can be. Cherish such relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Periodically evaluate yourself&lt;/strong&gt;: regularly question your view of reality and how distorted it can be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While sometimes you can be wrong, the world can also adopt your vision of reality. It happened in the past (after all, we are switching to electric cars, France dropped the Minitel for Internet), but it’s infrequent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always remember that we are all humans. When facing how wrong you are, be honest with yourself: face the reality you did not see, realize your mistake and blame no one but yourself. Cut your losses and move on. It is not about how hard wrong you were but how quickly you realize it and move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Code Inspector?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: this post is part of a series about the foundations for Code Inspector, you
can find the previous article &lt;a href=&quot;/software engineering/essay/humans/human behavior/2020/12/26/the-machine-is-better-than-you/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the last post in the series about Code Inspector. The &lt;a href=&quot;/software engineering/essay/humans/human behavior/2020/12/17/we-are-all-stupid/&quot;&gt;first post&lt;/a&gt;
focused on why humans are fallible by design and sub-optimal at executing
small and repetitive tasks. The &lt;a href=&quot;/software engineering/essay/humans/human behavior/2020/12/26/the-machine-is-better-than-you/&quot;&gt;second post&lt;/a&gt; focused on the
exponential progress of automation: tasks performed by machines
are getting more complex every day and soon, most of our jobs are
going to be automated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next paragraphs, I explain the main drivers for starting Code Inspector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-software-maintenance-problem&quot;&gt;The software maintenance problem&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a real struggle to develop software, especially because it is really
hard to find and understand the design and implementation choices made by the initial
authors. Software is often poorly documented, which makes it very complicated
to troubleshoot an issue or maintain an old codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average tenure for software developers is between 2 to 3 years. But
the software is operated and maintained for decades. As developers leave a
company their knowledge of a project leaves the company. &lt;strong&gt;In some industries,
the developers that maintains a software were not even born when the initial
system was designed.&lt;/strong&gt;. (Think twice about this!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some developers have no idea how the system they operate actually works.
It can take days or weeks to troubleshoot an issue because the system is way
too complex and the documentation, non-existent. And it is not common that issues
go unnoticed for months because developers do not understand the impact
of their scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an obvious need for a product that helps developers understand
a code base and establish a plan to improve it. This product needs to be
user-friendly, non-intimidating and to give clear actionable paths to improve
their codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-software-modernization-problem&quot;&gt;The software modernization problem&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software is like our physical infrastructure: it’s aging and
improving legacy software is a major undertaking. Reports estimates
that bad code and technical debt takes up to 30% of developer time
(see &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/files/reports/the-developer-coefficient.pdf&quot;&gt;Stripe study&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://redfin.engineering/pay-down-your-technical-debt-faster-by-limiting-your-payments-84fdca5e4ea3&quot;&gt;other sources&lt;/a&gt; estimate it’s more like 20%).
The same &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/files/reports/the-developer-coefficient.pdf&quot;&gt;study from Stripe&lt;/a&gt;
reports that bad code costs companies $85B annually. Even if you cut the estimate
in half, it’s still a number that makes you wonder if we should continue to write
code as we do today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two solutions to address the modernization problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hire more engineers, which increases costs exponentially and increases productivity linearly (at best).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automate software development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until very recently, only the first solution was possible. The recent
progress on software analysis and machine learning allows to automate
software development. This is a natural evolution: after all, today, Google translate
writes better English than I do and a Tesla drives better than I do
(on a highway for now). Why couldn’t a computer program better than I do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, only a few aspects will be automated. As the technology
develops, the scope of automation will grow and the human factor
in software development will shrink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-training-problem&quot;&gt;The training problem&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The change from manual to automated software development is not going to happen
overnight. Demand for software engineers will still be strong for the next ten
to twenty years and the two problems mentioned before (maintenance + modernization)
will require mode engineers over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department of labor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm&quot;&gt;already predicts&lt;/a&gt;
that demand for software engineers will grow by 20% in the next ten years.
The traditional education system cannot absorb this increase. The job
market for software engineers will be heavy on the demand (a lot of job
openings) and limited on the offer (not enough engineers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that many engineers will be under-trained and there will
be a need for additional training. A code automation platform
can help engineers to become better by providing guidance.
Such a platform will not only guide them in their work but also help them become
better software engineers by explaining why some modifications are recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-mission&quot;&gt;The mission&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mission of Code Inspector is clear: &lt;strong&gt;help developers produce better software&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three main aspects to achieve this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identification&lt;/strong&gt;: detect issues in a codebase, surface
them in a user-friendly interface and help developers prioritize software maintenance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automation&lt;/strong&gt;: automate resolution of bugs and
maintenance issues. Let the machine fix issues for you: it will do it better than
the majority of humans.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training&lt;/strong&gt;: incentivize developers to maintain a codebase, fix issues
and guide them through code changes (e.g. explain why they are done).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The financial impact is clear as well: with an average salary of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm&quot;&gt;$108,000 per year&lt;/a&gt;,
a product that makes engineers 1% more productive would already unlock a value
of $1,000 per engineer per year. And if such a product could even cut the time spent
in technical debt by 50%, it will then save $10,000 per developer per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a huge, underestimated problem and this
is why I left everything to focus on this project. The coming year is going
to be very exciting and I can’t wait for it to start.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The machine is better than you</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: this post is part of series about the foundations for Code Inspector, you
can find the previous article &lt;a href=&quot;/software engineering/essay/humans/human behavior/2020/12/17/we-are-all-stupid/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the industrial revolution (that started about 200 years ago),
we are delegating more complex tasks to machines.
At first, we delegated simple tasks on an assembly line. These machines
were better than humans in all aspects: they do not go on strike, they
do not stop to go to the bathrooms but most importantly: their results
and performance are &lt;strong&gt;consistent&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;predictable&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.giphy.com/media/XCxcmEQWxDdc8qsd2R/giphy-downsized.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Les Temps Modernes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of the machine does not depend on the discussion it had with
its partner the night before nor how much wine it had at the bar while chatting
with its friends. The machine delivers results according to objective,
non-ambiguous specifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, machines were dedicated to automate (mostly) blue collar jobs
(factory, farming, etc). But in the last twenty/thirty years, machines took
white-collar jobs too (in finance, security, sales, marketing).
Today, the computer fixes your grammar mistakes and optimizes your finance better than many humans would do.
They do it cheaper, faster, accelerating innovation across the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machines start to take over very complex tasks. And they are better than us at it.
The best example of how machines improved over the last ten years is
the autopilot technology from Tesla.
On highway, a Tesla drives better than you would drive. The car
stays perfectly within its lanes, better than you would do.
It still fails from time to time (especially in construction zones) and adapting
the car to such situations is just a question of time: 90% of the functionality is here and
achieving full self-driving is just a question of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.giphy.com/media/H7rpSYHRyYgamxQNqw/giphy-downsized.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Tesla Self Driving&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important aspect is that machines do the tasks they are dedicated to
better than humans. They do it &lt;strong&gt;consistently&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;predictably&lt;/strong&gt; and only
fail within their Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) which is measurable
and again, predictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we doomed to be replaced by machines? That is still not clear.
Machines are great at performing a task they are programmed for (such
as tighten a screw or drive a car). They will get better every day. And they
will learn to complete more complex tasks year after year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But machines still need to be told what to do.
We can program them to do perfectly one single task and they will do it better than us
on all dimensions.
But they are not the entity where ideas originates at first. That part is still
dedicated to humans. For now.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>We are all stupid</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: this post is part of series about the foundations for Code Inspector&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We, as humans, believe we are smart and intelligent. Granted, we can be
amazing creatures capable of the best and the worst. We can strap ourselves
to a giant ass rocket and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing&quot;&gt;go to the moon&lt;/a&gt;.
The same human machine can inadvertently kill itself &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_selfie-related_injuries_and_deaths&quot;&gt;while
taking a selfie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are inconsistent in our level of achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.giphy.com/media/KbZYGHClLQCB407kQW/giphy-downsized.gif&quot; alt=&quot;On the moon&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to programming, engineers believe they know better than
anyone else (even more than the machine) how to produce efficient code. Years ago,
developers were writing assembly code, claiming
that the C compiler was producing less efficient code. Unfortunately, even
if they achieved to be faster sometimes, it lead to having code that is
harder to maintain and is quickly being outdated (in terms
of performance and maintenance) by compiler optimizations. That led to some
questions from programmers wondering how C or C++ code can be faster than
their own assembly code (&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40354978/why-does-c-code-for-testing-the-collatz-conjecture-run-faster-than-hand-writte&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some may believe humans may outperform machines on small and repetitive tasks
but the reality is different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have proof every day about how we fail at doing repetitive tasks
that we know well. We know the road around our home but we will have
77% of accidents less than 15 miles around our home (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sawayalaw.com/blog/auto-accident-statistics-infographic/&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;).
Each year, more than 30,000 persons die on the road each year because of human
failure (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_fatality_rate_in_U.S._by_year&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;).
Even when we have rigorous training like in the aviation industry, the
vast majority of failure comes from humans factors: 88% of plane
crashes are attributed to pilot errors (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.baumhedlundlaw.com/aviation-accident/why-planes-crash/human-factors-in-aviation/&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humans are fallible by design.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started to automate the boring tasks. Machines are producing goods
with an amazing quality. Planes are flying themselves with little to no
guidance. Cars are now equipped with autopilot which keeps your vehicle in the
lane better than any human could do. The major blocker to speed up the acceleration
of these technologies is our acceptance. Keep in mind that no so long ago,
lift were operated by specialized workers (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_operator&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)
and they were also making mistakes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2015/07/31/427990392/remembering-when-driverless-elevators-drew-skepticism&quot;&gt;an interesting podcast about it&lt;/a&gt;). Who has any concern about safety when
entering an elevator these days?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machines are better than humans at small, boring and repetitive tasks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human machine is fallible by design. And this is what makes it so
wonderful. We do stupid things, either by omission
(we forget to do something) or commission (we do something we did not
intend to do). This is why you sometimes love or hate people.
As humans, we need to focus on complex problems and delegate
to machines repetitive and automatable tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On immutability</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: this page is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;/software engineering/essay/2020/03/06/software-engineering-series&quot;&gt;“Essays on Software Engineering”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered Scala and functional programming when I joined Twitter. Scala
introduced me to this new world
of pure functions and immutability. I loved it so much that I started teaching
the language for all new employees (if you ever attended my class, I
apologize for all the bad puns and jokes I made).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I really embraced functional programming as a discipline.
No matter what language I used, I try to always stick to some keys principles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pure functions&lt;/strong&gt;: the output of a function depends only on its inputs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;immutability&lt;/strong&gt;: keep all data immutable, any modification results in a copy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do not need to use a functional
programming language to use these principles, you can apply them
to almost any language. I use them while coding in Java and Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack&quot;&gt;John Carmack&lt;/a&gt;
also tried to apply these principles when building
the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Tech_4&quot;&gt;Doom 3 3D engine (idTech 4)&lt;/a&gt;, built
using C++.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1PhArSujR_A?start=124&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will skips the reason to use functional programming and focus on immutability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;idempotence-and-determinism&quot;&gt;Idempotence and determinism&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want your function to be easy to understand and test. Ideally, you want
the result of a function to be idem-potent: no matter how many times you
invoke the function, you get the same result if you provide the same inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That rule is being verified if you use immutable data, let’s illustrate this
principle with an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider a class &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; in an hybrid language:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;case class Person(name: String, age: Int)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, let’s define two &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;older&lt;/code&gt; functions. One that mutates the value
passed as parameters (let’s assume parameters are mutable).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Person older(person: Person, age: Int) {
  person.age = person.age + age;
  return person;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;older&lt;/code&gt; function where we use immutable data (and we copy the argument).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Person older(person: Person, age: Int) {
  return person.copy(age = person.age + age);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, consider the following block of code&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Person p = Person(&quot;foo&quot;, 42);

Person p2 = older(p, 10);
Person p3 = older(p, 10);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, what you really want is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;p2 == p3&lt;/code&gt; since they both have the same
inputs. Unfortunately, this will not work with the first function
since we mutate the value ahead of time. If you use the first
function, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;p3.age == 62&lt;/code&gt; and if you use the first function, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;p3.age == 52&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that such mutation will spread in your codebase like the
plague and will make really difficult to follow the codepath. Let 10
developers follow such practices and you will end up with spaghetti code
that becomes a nightmare to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immutability comes hand in hand with pure functions. If you want to embrace
immutability, embrace pure functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;parallelism&quot;&gt;Parallelism&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the hardest problem on computer science is to write correct
parallel programs. With computers having multiple cores all programs are
multi-threaded and data is being shared between cores/thread, which
requires to use locking mechanism (e.g. mutex, semaphore, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason we use mutex is precisely because a data is being mutated and
we want to guarantee only one thread modifies a data at a time. If you
use immutable data structure, these problems are non-existent for you
since you &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; modify data structure (you always copy and create
new data).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, using immutable data let’s you write scalable programs
from the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-cost-of-immutability&quot;&gt;The cost of immutability&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recurrent against immutable data is the additional runtime cost. The argument is that
using immutable data structures has a heavy runtime cost since you need to
allocate more memory to support instantiation of multiple objects. Using immutable
data then requires faster machines with more memory to run a program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This argument is a pure fallacy for two reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first reason is technical. There are a lot of technical tricks to implement
immutable data without having a huge runtime cost. For example, in Scala,
the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;copy()&lt;/code&gt; function generated for each &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case class&lt;/code&gt; makes
a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/case-classes.html&quot;&gt;shallow copy&lt;/a&gt; of a given object,
reducing drastically the runtime footprint of your program (compared to deep copy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second reason is pure economics.
The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-and-information-research-scientists.htm&quot;&gt;average salary of a computer scientist is $122,840&lt;/a&gt;.
Tech companies such as Stripe or Google have the best engineers and still
spend 10% to 20% of their time dealing
with bad code (source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/reports/developer-coefficient-2018&quot;&gt;Stripe study&lt;/a&gt;).
To put it more clearly: the cost of bad code is more than $10,000 to $20,000 per developer
per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality is: &lt;strong&gt;the cost of labor to write and maintain the software
is far higher than the cost of hardware&lt;/strong&gt;. Therefore, we should use all
potential methods (in terms of management, programming style or execution
platform) to reduce the labor costs. The use of immutability or functional
programming is only one candidate among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, engineers will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; believe they can outsmart the system
and produce a more efficient program by using some shady tricks (e.g. produce
better assembly cost than the C compiler). The reality
is that 99% of the time, they are dead wrong (e.g. compilers do a better job). And in the remaining 1%, the code should be carefully evaluated if this is worth the cost:
if the manual optimization is used, it will need to be maintained during the lifecyle
of the software (e.g. who wants to maintain assembly code if not an absolute necessity?).&lt;/p&gt;
