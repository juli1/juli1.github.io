        <title>Do not take yourself too seriously</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: this page is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;/software engineering/essay/2020/03/06/software-engineering-series&quot;&gt;“Essays on Software Engineering”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have worked with people that believe they invented the wheel
and are so unique thay you need to to listen to them and do exactly what they say
(in French, you would say &lt;em&gt;“ils pensent avoir inventé le fil à couper le beurre”&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such people take themselves too seriously. They believe that without them, the world
would not go round. They will try block you for the sake of being right when
in fact, all what they are is annoying. Do not be such a person. They are full of
themselves. And very boring. Life is not made to be boring. You are better than
this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The academic world is full of such people, frustrated that they did
not found what the neighbor invented and believe a solution cannot be good unless
they invent it. Many researchers are so frustrated
that they just reject others work, copy it, tweak it slightly to finally claim
a new invention. There is even a name for it: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here&quot;&gt;Not Invented Here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the very same behavior is present in the corporate world.
Remember that co-worker that criticizes other projects because it was lead
by their peers? Or this grumpy developer that re-implemented a piece of code
just because he does not like some obscure (and often, very subjective) aspect?
Would the reaction be the same if it was done by them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember how different teams duplicate work inside the same companies
instead of having shared code they can reuse? Or programmers not removing their
old deprecated code (aka &lt;em&gt;dead code&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;em&gt;“just in case”&lt;/em&gt; it might be useful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duplicate efforts can be useful sometimes. For example, when creating
the iPhone, Jobs had two teams: one implementing the phone using software, the
other using hardware. In this exact case, the objective was to compare
two ways of doing one thing (we all know the result: the software variation won).
But the vast majority of times, duplicating work
is an ego issue, with people thinking they are better than &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;insert-name-or-thing-here&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not be driven by your ego. This is not helping you to move forward and this
is mentally draining. This is also not helping people around you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, be driven by objective goals and metrics. If there is an objective
to improve quality of a particular piece of code, do not write a new project:
contribute to the existing one and improve its code coverage (remember
that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/&quot;&gt;re-writing projects from scratch rarely works&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe there are two powerful principles to follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be mindful of others.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not care yourself too seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first principle is basic and yet, often overlooked. Try to put yourself in other people shoes
and understand how they feel. That will help you empathize with the difficulties
they might be having. That often explain why or how they react
to a particular person or event. This principle is also illustrated
by the habit &lt;em&gt;“Seek to understand, then to be understood”&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People&quot;&gt;The 7 habits of Highly Effective People&lt;/a&gt;, an amazing book I would recommend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second principle is useful to put things in perspectives. You are a human
being that is failable by definition. You probably believe you are smart
and better than others because your mom, wife or dog told you.
In fact, as suggested by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect&quot;&gt;Dunning Kruger effect&lt;/a&gt;,
you are probably the worst person to know your own personal value. 
This fact is illustrated every day in the stock market: many &lt;del&gt;gamblers&lt;/del&gt;
investors believe they can beat the market when in reality, all what they
really get are losses. Similarly, many engineers believe they know how to
optimize code themselves manually when in reality, the compiler does it better
with optimization heuristics that have been implemented by researchers
and language specialists. You might like to think you are better than others
but you are probably not. Entertaining the idea of being that smart is
counter-productive and is not going to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will make mistakes and this is going to be okay.
Your challenge is not to not make mistake: you will do bad things sometimes, regardless how hard you try not to.
Your challenge is to put mechanisms and processes that will help you to avoid mistakes so that you catch them before you commit them.
In software, this is done by using defensive programming, increasing test coverage (unit/integration tests), and having good observability/monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not succeed because we are better than others.
We succeed because we understand how to be succesful with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So get back to work, be nice and do not take yourself too seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Freedom</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Within weeks, fundamental liberties have been sacrified in the name of safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we were previously infuriated by censorship and totalitarian governments,
we are now thankful to have &lt;del&gt;controlled&lt;/del&gt; curated information, either by
government or artificial intelligence. We are not even surprised when
our devices are used to track any progress of the disease when we were previously
worried about the use of device to track our moves. Nevermind if this is good or bad,
anything is good to sacrify in the name of safety. We
surrendered the right to be different or just disagree.
For ourselves or others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We accept to be forced to stay home. We accept to be controlled
and be told where to go, for how long. We accept to abdicate our
fundamental liberties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We fail to build a society where citizens are empowered to take decisions and
they rather accept to accept instructions at face value without any critical
thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sad.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Outside</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was a lucky day. I ran outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun was shining, the streets were empty. Shops were closed.
The only few people I saw were other runners or homelesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure how long it is going to last. We are ordered to stay
confined until experts evaluate we are safe to resume our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody knows how deadly is this outbreak. Or how long this is going to last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern society prepared us for this. The latest information
is carefully crafted, curated and displayed in near real-time on all devices,
making each of us experts able to understand and evaluate
carefully the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure for how long I will still have the permission to run outside.
Maybe soon I will have to stay inside, indefinitely.
That is for the good of the community, we cannot afford to take any risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I trust our leaders to put an end to this situation.
No doubt that will be given the permission to go outside soon.
And that we will be able to enjoy time together again.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Manage projects like you run a race</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: this page is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;/software engineering/essay/2020/03/06/software-engineering-series&quot;&gt;“Essays on Software Engineering”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to run long distance trail races. My last race was in 2016, a 100 km
race in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dcnr.pa.gov/StateParks/FindAPark/WorldsEndStatePark/Pages/default.aspx&quot;&gt;Worlds End State Park&lt;/a&gt;, in the middle of Pennsylvania.
That particular day, I did not plan to finish the race: my body was already
exhausted from years of running without much rest, I only wanted to finish
the first 50k. Surprisingly, that day, my body felt good and at the 40 km mark,
a race volunteer convinced me to keep going as I was way ahead in terms of time.
Hours later, I finished the race about 15 minutes before the cut-off, limping,
around midnight, after running about several miles without a lamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/worldsends.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Worlds Ends Race Picture&quot; /&gt;
The night before the race&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What went wrong that day? I did not plan to run 100k but 50k and
did not pack any battery or a lamp replacement. My mind was set on
running 50k from the start and not ready to go any longer. I did not plan
for the unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t like this before. When a race was less than 26 miles, I took it as a training run.
But when it was more than this, I meticulously planned it. I was
researching the elevation profile, checking support stations and
what food and liquids were provided. I prepare bags to drop at support stations located along the course and pack them with
more than twice of what I need: dry socks, food or a new t-shirt.
For each race, I clearly knew where and when I should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you think about it, a race is very simple: run X miles under Y hours.
There are constraints, such as the elevation profile, the weather or the type
of terrain. All of this can be planned and managed to reach the goal.
To succeed, all you need is to make sure you are trained, know what to
expect at regular interval of the race and have whatever you need through
the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I realized this process is no different than project management.
This is exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you start a project, you also have a goal (deliver X within Y months),
some constraints and resources. As for a race, if the goal is not realistic,
you do not sign up and come back if or when you evaluate this being feasible.
Once you sign up, you establish a roadmap that tells you what and when
things should be completed. You have milestones that show you the incremental
progress you are going to do over time. It gives a clear overview of the
project work plan, not only to you but to the team that can also discuss
potential dependencies and organize for them to be delivered on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it sound like basic project management to you? Yet, I still see many important projects
being started without even having milestones set. Engineers do not know
what they should be doing when they come to work. Even worse: sometimes, engineers
or managers do not even know what race they are running
(if they are running any). They are sometimes just lost in the company wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I start a project, I often try to plan it accordingly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a clear overview of the feasibility&lt;/strong&gt;: if not feasible, either readjust the scope of do not take the project: better to deliver nothing than strong disappointment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research and plan&lt;/strong&gt;: like when preparing a race, look for the main obstacles
in your project and make a plan to overcome them. Define objectives and milestones
in a way they are measurable (e.g. I finished the code of module X by date Y).
Write them down and communicate them to all internal stakeholders (your team, your sister teams).
Communicate more pessimistic milestones for the customer so that you have some margin if things go wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regularly check your progress&lt;/strong&gt; to check you can finish the race before the cut-off.
Look at your milestones every week and re-evaluate your work plan if needed. If you are ahead of time, you might help some other
projects that need support or just finish your project earlier and polish it (better to under promise and over deliver).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take large margins&lt;/strong&gt;: take at least 100% of margin, if you plan to complete a project in one month, ask for two months.
You might face unexpected issues, either human (one team member is ill or has some family issues) or technical and this margin is here to take the unexpected into account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are simple rules. No matter how experienced you are, not following
them can transform a nice race halfway into a long nightmare. And regardless of
experience, many people do not apply them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following these rules and processes helped me to manage multiple
projects simultaneously and deliver them before the estimated delivery time. I now schedule my life
according to them. It helped me to track what I should be doing and ensure
that I complete all the tasks I want to do within a day, a weekend or a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing projects is very simple: manage them as you run a race.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Essays on Software Engineering</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After several years in the technology industry and living in various places,
I wanted to take the time to write some thoughts. Working on various
domains (such as aerospace, academia, data center management or ads),
living in different countries (or even states within the USA) and achieving
certains goals (such as losing half of my weight or running ultra distances)
helped me to see commonalities between domains and establish parallels
between worlds you would consider unrelated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building software helped me to better understand real-life problems.
And leading non-tech projects also helped me building better software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example would be fixing properties. When you fix a house,
you architect the new building, you schedule the work, establish milestones
and you clearly see dependencies. For example, you do not start painting before
the dry walls are properly installed and sealed. Yet, developers often
overlook such basic rules, even in regulated industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next six months, I will write a new article each month that will
talk about one aspect similar to the one above. I have no idea or expectation about this
experiment, I just hope it will be as useful to you as it will be to me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Google is the new Microsoft</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Google is the new Microsoft. What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-history&quot;&gt;Some History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by explaining what was Microsoft twenty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, is the company (or at least, his CEO) that once categorized
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/02/ballmer_linux_is_a_cancer/&quot;&gt;Linux as cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the company that did not respect technologies standards (especially
HTML/CSS) to put away competition, which resulted in a horrible developer
and user experience. Internet Explorer 6 was considered &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_6#Criticism&quot;&gt;one of the worst
product of all time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also the company that developed a collaborative scheduling Operating
System (all Windows before XP) when superior solutions already existed at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And worst, this is the company that integrated such pictures in a text editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/clippy.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Working From Home&quot; width=&quot;20%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the company with a crazy CEO (in the bad sense) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/portable-devices/mp3-players/computing/apple/ballmer-apple-iphone-will-be-massive-flop-154018&quot;&gt;that predicted in 2007
the iPhone will be a flop&lt;/a&gt; and acquired Nokia (a company that was completely done and no future) after 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vhh_GeBPOhs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, the company is doing better, thanks to a new CEO that brought
the company back on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But ten to twenty years ago, Microsoft was lost. They did not have good products,
no identity and no soul. And this is where Google is today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;product-hell&quot;&gt;Product hell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Google products were great. I remember when GMail was offering
a GB to store my emails where Hotmail was offering 100 MB at most. The interface
was fast, convenient: everything you expected for such a product. They were
following key engineering principles: keep it simple and stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, products started to be bloated. And slow. GMail started to
look like Outlook or even Lotus Notes, especially on non-Chrome browsers.
Products started to be counter-intuitive, exactly how
Microsoft Word currently is. Google Cloud Console is the perfect example of a terrible
user experience where nothing is intuitive and you need to go to the
documentation &lt;strong&gt;each time&lt;/strong&gt; you use the product. There is a clear lack
of prioritization at the company where new features are stacked and developed
in spite of common design sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a clear lack of innovation. Over the last years, Google failed
to create new innovative products. Every attempt to start a social network
failed miserably and new products are being thrown into
the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gcemetery.co/&quot;&gt;Google cemetery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-morale&quot;&gt;No morale&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside the company, it seems there is no morale. The perfect example is
when the company did not immediately react to a sexual harassment case
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/google-reportedly-paid-andy-rubin-90m-despite-charge-of-sexual-misconduct/&quot;&gt;kept giving a $90M bonus package to the alleged culprit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same low morale also applies to the products. Google that once praised
standardization is now behaving exactly like Microsoft, when they had
a monopoly in the browser market. It is now not a mystery that Google is
changing its web
applications to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps/news/youtube-speed-faster-google-chrome-mozilla-firefox-microsoft-edge-1889651&quot;&gt;slow down competitors such as Firefox or Edge&lt;/a&gt;.
Exactly what Microsoft did with Internet Explorer 6 fifteen years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These repeated practices show that instead of innovating, Google is trying to
make the competitors look bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want to be their customers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-not-be-evil&quot;&gt;Do not be evil&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of Google is simple: the new cool kids were here to revolutionize
the internet. At the very beginning, Google was a game changer: a search
on the internet was taking less than a second. Their product were cool. And free.
They were the Microsoft anti-thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spirit of the company was simple: be cool. Or rather: &lt;em&gt;Don’t be evil&lt;/em&gt;.
To developers, it meant a lot. It meant that somebody was doing the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; thing
and was not going to sell their soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this time is now gone, as the previous paragraphs shown.
It was officially &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393&quot;&gt;reflected in the company internal documents in 2018&lt;/a&gt;.
And it is now &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt; for Google to be evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake: Google is the new Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Java or Scala, that is the question</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last two years, I had the opportunity to gain knowledge on Scala
and also re-learn Java (after about 3 years without using it). I built network
analysis tools in Scala and used it to entirely write the backend of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.code-inspector.com&quot;&gt;Code Inspector&lt;/a&gt; with it. In the meantime, when
starting to recently form a new engineering team, I had to use (and re-learn) Java again. I wanted
to reflect on this experience to share some thoughts as to where these languages
stand, the directions they are taking and answer the
question too-often asked: which one to use?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;java-has-evolved-a-lot-and-for-the-better&quot;&gt;Java has evolved a lot, and for the better&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java evolved a lot over its about 20 years of existence. From a simple object-oriented language, it
brought fundamental changes. One example is the change in the for-loop syntax
in Java 5 or the introduction of lambda in Java 8. As the language became very
popular, developers added a ton of libraries for it and the language became very
popular with infamous application (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://hadoop.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Hadoop&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://spring.io/&quot;&gt;Spring&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.playframework.com/&quot;&gt;Play&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the community around the language built libraries to overcome some
of its limitations. One good example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/guava&quot;&gt;Guava&lt;/a&gt;,
the library developed by Google that provides a lot of helper methods
and class to overcome some clear limitations of the language (e.g. the
lack of support of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Optional&lt;/code&gt; - more on this later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;functional-programming-has-proven-to-be-clean-and-effective&quot;&gt;Functional Programming has proven to be clean and effective&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, it is becoming clear that Object-Oriented programming (OO)
is not the silver bullet we thought it will be. Many people believed it was
a revolution in the programming world (e.g. Steve Jobs at
  was pitching the use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://computerhistory.org/blog/the-deep-history-of-your-apps-steve-jobs-nextstep-and-early-object-oriented-programming/&amp;gt;`_&quot;&gt;OO for NeXT&lt;/a&gt; long time ago, seeing it as revolutionary).
I belong to the group of engineers that were taught OO was the right way to build
programs (and even learned &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merise&quot;&gt;Merise&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language&quot;&gt;UML&lt;/a&gt;).
It is then no surprise that at first, I was very skeptical about the benefits of FP, especially after having used Java and
C++ for the last 5+ years. My interest in FP really started to increase after watching
this video of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack&quot;&gt;John Carmack&lt;/a&gt; on the topic
where he explains the real issues our industry is facing and how FP is helping to write
simpler programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1PhArSujR_A&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After few months, it became obvious that Functional Programming (FP) helps to write programs
that are easier to maintain and reason about it. The use of immutability avoids
side-effects and basic errors such as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt; that
have been plaguing programs for decades. As human, we fail to reason about
programs structure and do not build systems with the idea that people will
 maintain it for the years to come. And these problems increase as the size
 of the programs (and the number of engineers working on it) increases.
We can argue that these problems can be solved
using more processes and tools (static analyzer, automated checks during reviews, etc.),
but at the end of the day, what matters is to write something
simple from the start to avoid problems and additional work later in the development
process. The key idea is to keep thing simple from the start.
FP forces you to separate concerns (data vs. functions) and write
understandable code using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function&quot;&gt;pure functions&lt;/a&gt; where outputs only depends on the inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a mental model and design perspective, the clear separation between
data (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case class&lt;/code&gt; in Scala) and the functions that process it helps you to
reasons about your data flow. Finally, the use of pure functions facilitates
testing and is probably the biggest take-away from FP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons that make FP superior to OO and so far, I believe that
the best summary has been written by Joe Amstrong, creator
of Erlang, who summarizes most of them in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/staffpriv/ok/Joe-Hates-OO.htm&quot;&gt;great essay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OO was probably a good intention but &lt;a href=&quot;https://nickfoy.com/blog/2018/4/7/good-intentions-dont-work&quot;&gt;good intentions don’t work&lt;/a&gt; (probably the best thing I learned from my time at Amazon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;java-evolves-in-the-direction-of-scala&quot;&gt;Java evolves in the direction of Scala&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is now clear that Java is now taking the direction of Scala since several years
One of the obvious sign is the introduction of lambda in Java 8, a first-class
citizen concept of the Scala language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example is the push from the community to support Scala-like constructions
such as the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Optional&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/guava&quot;&gt;guava&lt;/a&gt;
(or even the helper methods to improve the default implementation of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;toString&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;equals&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hashCode&lt;/code&gt; - there are plenty of examples).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last example in date is the project [Amber from Java|https://openjdk.java.net/projects/amber/)
that is copying core Scala features such as [pattern matching|https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/305], &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case class&lt;/code&gt;
(renamed &lt;a href=&quot;https://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/amber/datum.html&quot;&gt;data classes&lt;/a&gt;) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/286&quot;&gt;type inference&lt;/a&gt;.
Once project Amber is done, you could write code like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (obj instanceof String s || s.length() &amp;gt; 5) {s.contains(&quot;foo&quot;)}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exact same functionality exists in Scala since its inception and the same
code would look like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;obj match {
  case s: String if s.length() &amp;gt; 5 =&amp;gt; s.contains(&quot;foo&quot;)
  case _ =&amp;gt; false
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that a bad thing that Java is copying Scala? In fact, this is really healthy.
And definitively shows the value of the concepts behind the language.
However, as these features are added on top of a already complex language, it brings
a new set of problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;you-cannot-get-rid-of-the-past&quot;&gt;You cannot get rid of the past&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue by introducing this new FP-compliant features on top of an old language is
the new level of complexity and the related ambiguity it might bring.
As the language needs to stay backward-compatible
with the existing feature, the new one are added without deprecating the old one,
which let programmers do whatever they wants since no rule will be enforced
by the compiler. This brings consistency issues in the codebase (use of multiple
coding patterns in the language), which confuses developers and make program
maintenance even more complex. One good example of such problem is large C++
codebase that tried to evolve to later versions (for example, when mixing
raw and smart pointers in C++).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These additional features do not address the main shortcoming of the
language (OO, mutable variables, separation of concerns, etc.) and do not force the developer to use
FP. It offers the possibility to use it but does not mandate it, which means
that using FP must be enforced through a human process that is fallible by
definition. Not good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;so-what-language-to-choose&quot;&gt;So what language to choose?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is now clear that FP languages are superior in terms of maintenance, which
is the biggest cost in software today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One argument that is often made against Scala is the lack of candidates
that know Scala. That might be true if you are looking for a temporary position
but otherwise, if you hire a developer because of its familiarity
with a particular language, this is not good for the long term. It is better
to focus on the fundamentals (data structure, algorithms, etc.) than on
a particular technology. Learning Scala does not take much time. My experience after one year
  of teaching Scala showed me that engineers understands the fundamentals within a month).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are starting a new project from scratch, Scala is a good choice and its
compatibility with Java lets you use any existing Java library
(and there are tons of it). That should
open the best of both worlds by having a great language a a ton of existing
and reliable libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if you already have an existing codebase, should you dump Java and start to rewrite everything in Scala? Probably not. Or at least,
not that fast. This would be a non-sense to dump a large codebase built, matured
and stabilized for years to only switch to a new language. And it would
also be an immediate, visible loss of productivity as all engineers are starting
to learn Scala. The best way forward is to start using new features of the language for the
existing code, and put processes (such as automatic checks) in place
to make sure the codebase stays consistent. If you start re-writing some
services or decompose them, it can be a good idea to start using Scala
(and its compatibility with Java helps in that direction) and let few engineers
explore and experiment the language (reducing the potential loss of productivity).
You can then judge for yourself how comfortable your engineers are with this
transition but also evaluates the potential benefits gradually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;final-words&quot;&gt;Final Words&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this small article is in favor of Scala, the most important idea is
that Functional Programming principles help you writing re-usable and
maintainable code and that Object-Oriented principles were probably a mistake
the industry followed blindly. FP rules and principles can be implemented by
developers in almost any language (see Carmack talk mentioned above) And they
help you write better programs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Effective code review</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote some thoughts for improving code reviews within my team.
It started like a 5 minutes brain-dump at 6:30 in the morning on my way to work and I ended up iterating and refining the list
several times over a few days. This gave me the opportunity to reflect on the differences between the code
review processes among
the various places that I worked at. Also, I strongly believe the environment (academic, industry) matters a lot.
I wanted to share these thoughts as code review can be the
cause of many tensions within a development team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three types of rules: general ones that apply to both the submitter/reviewer,
submitter rules and reviewer rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These guidelines are not perfect, take them as they are: an attempt to formalize what I believe
we should shoot for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;general-guidelines&quot;&gt;General Guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always assume good intentions&lt;/strong&gt;. People are not commenting on your code to harm you. They are trying to help you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be thankful for having reviews&lt;/strong&gt;, people are dedicating time to look at your work. No matter
the experience of the submitter and reviewer, there is always a chance it can make you a better programmer or co-worker.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always try to understand first, and then, be understood&lt;/strong&gt;. This comes from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People&quot;&gt;7 habits&lt;/a&gt; and is especially helpful in that context.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During a conversation, get the perspective of the other person&lt;/strong&gt;, try to put yourself in his/her shoes. This will often help you understand why a comment is made and help you discuss and resolve it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reviewer-guidelines&quot;&gt;Reviewer Guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand there is more than one way to do it - (c) &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it&quot;&gt;Perl&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;/strong&gt;.
The goal of code is to solve problems. A problem might have several solutions that are equally effective.
Acknowledge and accept that somebody might choose to solve a problem differently than you would do.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specify explicitly if a comment/problem is blocking the code to be shipped&lt;/strong&gt;: some code review
systems allow you to distinguish blocking/non-blocking issues. Try to make use of it
so that the submitter can prioritize changes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep discussion/comments in the review system&lt;/strong&gt;: it also serves other members to learn about
potential issues and not replicate them. Ultimately, if you need to talk in person (sometimes, there is
nothing like a face to face discussion), do it but write the outcome in the review for traceability purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you point out a flaw in the code/approach, try to propose an alternative&lt;/strong&gt;: telling somebody that his/her
code is bad is not very useful if there is no indication for fixing the issue. Try to explain why this
is bad and give some ideas how to address the issue. If this is a simple issue (syntax error or coding
style violation), just mention this without spending much time to give details.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the review matters to you, do it soon&lt;/strong&gt;, probably within 24 hours and the exact delay is something
a team should discuss. It is better for everybody
to get it done quickly: all ideas are still fresh in the head of the submitter, it does not delay
progress on new features, etc. Do not blame the submitter if some code has been shipped without you reviewing it
if it was for review for several days: the blame is probably to put on you for not reviewing it in a timely manner.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When discussing or arguing a change&lt;/strong&gt; try to relate to coding guidelines, best practices or business goals.
There is no point requesting a change if you &lt;em&gt;“just prefer this style”&lt;/em&gt;: you should have a valid, objective reason
to request that.
For example, I personally almost always consider readability and maintainability as one of the most important aspects of code (software
maintenance and developer time is more expensive than computing resources). But
sometimes, good readability must be impacted to favor performance: in some businesses I have been, winning few nanoseconds
on a code path matters more than having clean and readable code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;submitter-guidelines&quot;&gt;Submitter Guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link your change your issue tracker (Jira, github, etc.)&lt;/strong&gt; and follow the rule that 1 code change belongs to one ticket (one ticket
can have multiple code changes). It improves traceability with user stories and facilitates progress tracking
on a particular task. Design decisions, issues, etc. should be discussed in the ticket, not in the review itself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make short reviews&lt;/strong&gt; and try to keep one code change per problem and per component. 
First, it avoids long code review that will take days
to complete and will ultimately cause merge problems (need to re-base on master, etc.). Second, reviewers are less
likely to complete a long code review in a short period of time, which ultimately, will slow you down.
Prefer several, incremental reviews to a larger reviews on dozens of files.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If there are some temporary code that will be changed later&lt;/strong&gt;: put a comment in the code with your login that explains
why this is delayed and when this should be addressed. Having a random &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FIXME&lt;/code&gt; without reason is not acceptable, having
temporary incomplete code is OK as long as we have a reason for it and a plan to address it in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address comments in the review&lt;/strong&gt;: people invest time doing review, respects the work they put in your review
and answer their comments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are doing pair programming, the ship from your pair does not count&lt;/strong&gt;: code review is there to expose the code
to other opinions and people in your team. Code developed in pair lacks this external point of view. Having the pair
shipping the code is like if the code was being shipped by its author. It defeats the purpose of code review.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specify how you tested the components in your review&lt;/strong&gt;: some review system allow you to specify how you tested
the software. Copy/paste the command you used to run the test. If you deploy to a testing environment, put the
commend you used. It has two purposes: show the level of testing you did and, ensure that the software still
deploys and run (at least in the testing environment).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If one comment upsets you, come back to it later&lt;/strong&gt;: one particular comment might irritate you and after reading
it, you may want to reply in a sarcastic way or to just ignore it. Do not do any of these things. Take some time,
try to have the perspective of the reviewer, and then, reply. Stick to the point. Try to understand why the reviewer
raised that issue and show your good faith about solving this issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Kinesis keyboard report</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/&quot;&gt;Kinesis Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, and more
particularly the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/&quot;&gt;Kinesis Advantage&lt;/a&gt; model
that I am using since 4 months now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-a-kinesis-advantage-keyboard&quot;&gt;What is a kinesis advantage keyboard?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kinesis-ergo.com&quot;&gt;Kinesis&lt;/a&gt; is a company based in Seattle that manufactures 
ergonomic keyboards (and other devices).
The Advantage is an ergonomic keyboard that should help anybody with some sort of pain
in the joints (hands, etc). They keyboard looks very futurist, very cool, there is a picture
of my actual keyboard at work (with a Twitter key!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/kinesis.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kinesis keyboard&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-getting-one&quot;&gt;Why getting one?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason is to be more comfortable while typing on your keyboard and avoid
injuries (hand, wrist). You might
increase your typing speed but that is definitively not the primary reason I
wanted to get one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using a kinesis, you literally don’t need to move your hand to type &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;.
Your hands rest on the palm support and you just move your fingers, nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people reported improvements and I do too. I had pain regularly in my wrist and 
always thought it was due to aging and there was nothing to do to improve this. The pain
was not strong or acute enough to see a doctor but it bothered me enough to sporadically
stop typing for few hours every few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many other reasons to get a kinesis (programmable keys for example), but these functions
are also available in other keyboards too. The real killer feature of the kinesis (at least for me) is how
comfortable it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;is-it-worth-it&quot;&gt;Is it worth it?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are typing on a keyboard several hours a day, this is probably worth it. If your job
(and then, primary source of income) depends on being able to type on a keyboard, you might
consider buying one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to know if this is a good idea to get one if you do not
experience any pain - after all, I am not a doctor. I decided to try because I had issues 
and the keyboard fixed them but
there is no clue if my issues was related to my previous hardware. All I know is that I no
longer have pain when using a kinesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kinesis is expensive (more than $300) but 
I strongly believe that many developers invest too much on hardware and not enough on their development environment
(desk, mouse, keyboard, etc.). At that price, I consider this is a good investment
(it keeps the pain away so that I can code as much as I want).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;advices-on-getting-started&quot;&gt;Advices on getting started&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is really difficult to get started. And this is very frustrating to learn again how to type on keyboard.
In the beginning, you type as if you are wearing ski gloves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The keyboard will also keep your brain busy (&lt;em&gt;“what key I am typing?”&lt;/em&gt;), which
can be mentally exhausting. To start, type
things that do not require your brain to work: answer to some basic e-mail, write reports, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, alternate the regular keyboard and the kinesis: your brain need to assimilate the new keymap
and so, giving a break is a good idea too. When I started, I was using the kinesis all anything
that did not require any thinking and switch to the regular keyboard when I needed to think
of what I was typing (such as programming).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will take at least two weeks to start typing correctly and one month to be efficient.
After two months, you should be back at your normal speed or even faster. And
you will then never go back on another keyboard!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Learning Scala in 2018</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Four months ago, I had to learn &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scala-lang.org&quot;&gt;Scala&lt;/a&gt;
and be familiar with the language in order to contribute to a large Scala codebase.
I was familiar with Java (I spent 4+ years maintaining &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.osate.org&quot;&gt;OSATE&lt;/a&gt; while working
at Carnegie Mellon) and I thought that it would be somehow easy, quick and painless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was dead wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, Scala runs on top of the JVM but it does not mean it shares so much with Java. Scala is a functional programming language and is way more
complicated than Java. This is another level of complexity. 
I started to contribute to a codebase
with people writing Scala for 4+ years and use the nice and barely documented features for advanced
users. With such a complicated language, the learning curve was very steep and I had to go through it
very quickly to be able to produce anything meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; hard. But not painful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love learning and I had a ton of fun learning a new language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After three months, I am still learning every day and continue to read about advanced features
of the language. But I am now somewhat familiar enough with the basics concepts of Scala that I can be
an active contributor in different projects and teach the language fundamentals at my work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to share the current state of the resources to learn Scala in 2018. After 14 years
of existence, a lot of materials have been produced and I wanted to share what has been 
working for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-good&quot;&gt;The Good&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://horstmann.com/scala/index.html&quot;&gt;Scala The Impatient&lt;/a&gt; is a good resource but way too light. It covers only some very basic concepts and you do not see some advanced features that are really interesting. Read it but do not stop there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The blog post series of &lt;a href=&quot;https://danielwestheide.com/&quot;&gt;Daniel Westheide&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://danielwestheide.com/scala/neophytes.html&quot;&gt;The Neophyte’s Guide to Scala&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;strong&gt;must-read&lt;/strong&gt; if you are new to Scala. The examples are great, with many details.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Scala-Updated-2-12/dp/0981531687/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1528782250&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=odersky+scala&quot;&gt;Programming in Scala&lt;/a&gt; by Martin Odersky: great resource to go deeper about the internals of the language
(how containers work, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.github.io/util/&quot;&gt;Twitter util&lt;/a&gt; all the code developed by Twitter, an early adopter of Scala&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scalacookbook.com/&quot;&gt;The Scala Cookbook&lt;/a&gt; by Alvin Alexander.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-bad&quot;&gt;The Bad&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classes on Coursera are unfortunately not that great.
There is a specialization dedicated to Scala and I completed two of the classes in that specialization.
I was very disappointed by the content, especially because I love Coursera (and completed 
great classes on the platform).
Some of the assignments do not match the class, the content is often too confusing.
This specialization is not free (you need to pay a $50 montly membership), which would be &lt;em&gt;ok&lt;/em&gt; 
if the content was good. Unfortunately, this is not that great and I would recommend to stick
with other resources (like the blog posts from &lt;a href=&quot;https://danielwestheide.com/scala/neophytes.html&quot;&gt;Westheide&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;focus-on-the-functional-programming-concepts&quot;&gt;Focus on the Functional Programming concepts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best advice I could give is to focus on the principles of functional programming. Do not focus
too much on the syntax and other details (such as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case class&lt;/code&gt;). Just learn and practice functional 
programming concepts such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monad&lt;/strong&gt;: this is just a container but a fundamental concept for functional programming. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@sinisalouc/demystifying-the-monad-in-scala-cc716bb6f534&quot;&gt;Good article that explains the Monad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All &lt;strong&gt;transformations functions&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;flatMap&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;drop&lt;/code&gt;. Know them. Practice them. RTFM the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scala-lang.org/api&quot;&gt;Scala API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-is-tail-recursion-1&quot;&gt;tail recursion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and understand why recursing other a list with 10,000 elements will not &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow&quot;&gt;blow up your stack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;use-a-good-ide&quot;&gt;Use a good IDE&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you cut meat, you do not use the bread knife. Similarly, when you program in Scala, you
do not use vim or emacs. You could but this is just inefficient and a waste of time when
great IDE provide a ton of support for understanding the source code and digging into
the standard library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/&quot;&gt;IntelliJ&lt;/a&gt; and I am regularly discovering new capabilities
(and amazed by many features, such as refactoring). There are my two favorite features
in this IDE:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you press the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shift&lt;/code&gt; key three times very quickly a search dialog appears and you can search for anything inside your project (thanks Adam for the tip!).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Just do &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;command+click&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;alt+click&lt;/code&gt; on a variable, reference, type to go to its declaration. Very powerful to browse and explore code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;code-repository&quot;&gt;Code Repository&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started a repository that contains code samples for Scala beginners.
This is a way to share some code with beginners and help newcomers in the Scala community.
This code is intentionally over-documented and often explains what the code does
step by step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can find the repository at:  &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/juli1/scala-cookbook&quot;&gt;https://github.com/juli1/scala-cookbook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
