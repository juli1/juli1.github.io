  <p><em>Note: this page is part of the <a href="/software engineering/essay/2020/03/06/software-engineering-series">“Essays on Software Engineering”</a></em></p>

<p>I used to run long distance trail races. My last race was in 2016, a 100 km
race in <a href="https://www.dcnr.pa.gov/StateParks/FindAPark/WorldsEndStatePark/Pages/default.aspx">Worlds End State Park</a>, in the middle of Pennsylvania.
That particular day, I did not plan to finish the race: my body was already
exhausted from years of running without much rest, I only wanted to finish
the first 50k. Surprisingly, that day, my body felt good and at the 40 km mark,
a race volunteer convinced me to keep going as I was way ahead in terms of time.
Hours later, I finished the race about 15 minutes before the cut-off, limping, around midnight, after running
about several miles without a lamp.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/worldsends.jpg" alt="Worlds Ends Race Picture" />
The night before the race</p>

<p>What went wrong that day? I did not plan to run 100k but 50k and
did not pack any battery or a lamp replacement. My mind was set on
running 50k from the start and not ready to go any longer. I did not plan
for the unexpected.</p>

<p>It wasn’t like this before. When a race was less than 26 miles, I took it as a training run.
But when it was more than this, I meticulously planned it. I was
researching the elevation profile, checking support stations and
what food and liquids were provided. I prepare bags to drop at support station and packed them with
more than twice of what I need: dry socks, food or a new t-shirt.
For each race, I clearly knew where and when I should be.</p>

<p>When you think about it, a race is very simple: run X miles under Y hours.
There are constraints, such as the elevation profile, the weather or the type
of terrain. All of this can be planned and managed to reach the goal.
To succeed, all you need is to make sure you are trained, know what to
expect at regular interval of the race and have whatever you need through
the race.</p>

<p>Over the years, I realized this process is no different than project management.
This is exactly the same.</p>

<p>When you start a project, you also have a goal (deliver X within Y months),
some constraints and resources. As for a race, if the goal is not realistic,
you do not sign up and come back when you evaluate this being feasible.
Once you sign up, you establish a roadmap that tells you what and when
things should be completed. You have milestones that show you the incremental
progress you are going to do over time. It gives a clear overview of the
project work plan, not only to you but to the team that can also discuss
potential dependencies and organize for them to be delivered on time.</p>

<p>Does it sounds basic project management to you? Yet, I still see many important projects
being started without even having milestones set. Engineers do not know
what they should be doing when they come at work. Even worse: sometimes, engineers
or managers do not even know what race they are running
(if they are running any). They are sometimes just lost in the company wilderness.</p>

<p>When I start a project, I often try to plan it accordingly:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Have a clear overview of the feasibility</strong>: if not feasible, either readjust the scope of do not take the project: better to deliver nothing than strong disappointment.</li>
  <li><strong>Research and plan</strong>: like when preparing a race, look for the main obstacles
in your project and make a plan to overcome them. Define objectives and milestones
in a way they are measurable (e.g. I finished the code of module X by date Y).
Write them down and communicate them to all internal stakeholders (your team, your sister teams).
Communicate more pessimistic milestones for the customer so that you have some margin if things go wrong.</li>
  <li><strong>Regularly check your progress</strong> to check you can finish the race before the cut-off.
Look at your milestones every week and re-evaluate your work plan if needed. If you are ahead of time, you might help some other
projects that need support or just finish your project earlier and polish it (better to under promise and over deliver).</li>
  <li><strong>Take large margins</strong>: take at least 100% of margin, if you plan to complete a project in one month, ask for two months.
You might face unexpected issues, either human (one team member is ill or has some family issues) or technical and this margin is here to take the unexpected into account.</li>
</ol>

<p>These are simple rules. Not following them can transform a nice race half way
into a long nightmare when you injure yourself.</p>

<p>Following these rules and processes helped me to manage multiple
projects simultaneously and deliver them before the estimated delivery time. I now schedule my life
according to these rules. It helped me to track what I should be doing and ensure
that I complete all the tasks I want to do within a day or a weekend.</p>

<p>Managing projects is very simple: manage them as you run a race.</p>
